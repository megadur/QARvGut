## API Design and Endpoints

### Enhanced User Management API Endpoints

**Bulk Operations:**
- `POST /api/account/users/bulk-import` - Import users from CSV/JSON
- `POST /api/account/users/bulk-roles` - Bulk role assignment
- `POST /api/account/users/bulk-activate` - Bulk activation/deactivation
- `GET /api/account/users/export` - Export users with filtering

**Advanced Search and Filtering:**
- `GET /api/account/users/search?department={}&role={}&status={}&page={}` - Advanced search
- `GET /api/account/users/activity?fromDate={}&toDate={}` - Activity reports

**Profile Management:**
- `PUT /api/account/users/{id}/profile` - Update extended profile
- `GET /api/account/users/{id}/activity` - User activity history

All endpoints follow existing patterns:
- Authorization via `[Authorize(AuthPolicies.ViewAllUsersPolicy)]` and similar
- Response format consistent with existing UserVM patterns
- Error handling following current controller conventions

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Existing Pattern Preservation:** All new endpoints use existing authorization policies
- **Role-Based Access:** Admin-only operations protected by `AuthPolicies.ManageAllUsersPolicy`
- **Data Protection:** Sensitive profile data access controlled by existing user authorization handlers

### Data Security
- **Profile Data:** Extended profile fields follow existing data protection patterns
- **Activity Tracking:** Login and activity data treated as audit information with appropriate access controls
- **Bulk Operations:** Administrative operations logged and audited

### API Security
- **Input Validation:** All new endpoints follow existing validation patterns via `[SanitizeModel]` attribute
- **Bulk Operation Limits:** File size and record count limits to prevent abuse
- **Rate Limiting:** Inherited from existing API rate limiting configuration

## Performance Considerations

### Database Performance
- **Indexing Strategy:** New indexes on Department, IsActive, LastLoginDate for efficient searching
- **Query Optimization:** Pagination for large result sets, efficient filtering queries
- **Migration Impact:** Additive-only migrations minimize downtime risk

### API Performance
