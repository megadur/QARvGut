# Story 1.1: E2E Testing Framework Setup & Infrastructure

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** QA Engineer and Developer,  
**I want** a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework configured with Cypress, TypeScript, and CI/CD integration,  
**so that** I can create reliable automated tests for critical user journeys and ensure system quality before deployments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Framework Installation & Configuration**
   - Cypress e2e testing framework installed and configured with TypeScript support
   - Project structure follows Page Object Model pattern for maintainable test organization
   - Test configuration files properly set up for local and CI/CD environments

2. **Test Data Management System**
   - Automated test database seeding and cleanup functionality implemented
   - Test data factory integration with existing TestDataFactory patterns
   - Isolated test environment ensures no interference with existing data

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow configured for automated e2e test execution
   - Test execution triggers on pull requests and main branch pushes
   - Test reports and artifacts (screenshots, videos) generated and stored

4. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Local test execution environment configured for developers
   - Test runner scripts and npm commands available for development workflow
   - Documentation for running tests locally and in different environments

5. **Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure**
   - E2E tests complement existing xUnit unit tests and integration tests
   - No conflicts with existing test execution processes
   - Shared test utilities and patterns maintained for consistency

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information

**Existing Test Infrastructure:**
- `QARvGut.Tests/` - Existing unit and integration test project with xUnit framework
- `QARvGut.Tests/Unit/ApplicationUserTests.cs` - User entity testing patterns
- `QARvGut.Tests/Integration/` - API integration test patterns
- `docs/stories/1.1-testing-documentation.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation from Story 1.1

**Angular Client Structure:**
- `QARvGut/QARvGut.client/` - Angular 19 SPA frontend
- `QARvGut/QARvGut.client/src/app/` - Main application components
- `QARvGut/QARvGut.client/package.json` - Frontend dependencies and scripts
- Existing Angular testing with Jasmine framework

**Technology Stack Integration:**
- .NET Core 9.0 Web API backend with PostgreSQL database
- Existing authentication system with JWT tokens and role-based authorization
- Angular 19 frontend with established routing and component patterns

**Key Integration Points:**
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (planned but needs configuration)
- Test database configuration and data management
- Authentication testing must work with existing JWT/OAuth2 implementation
- User role testing must align with existing Assessor/Manager/Admin roles

### Framework Selection Rationale

**Cypress Selected Over Playwright:**
- Better integration with existing Angular/TypeScript stack
- Excellent developer experience with time-travel debugging
- Strong community support and documentation for Angular applications
- Real browser testing with comprehensive DOM interaction capabilities

**Project Structure:**
```
QARvGut.E2E.Tests/
├── cypress/
│   ├── e2e/
│   ├── fixtures/
│   ├── support/
│   └── pages/ (Page Object Model)
├── cypress.config.ts
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Testing Standards

**Test File Location:**
- Create new `QARvGut.E2E.Tests` project in solution root
- E2E test files in `cypress/e2e/` directory
- Page objects in `cypress/pages/` directory
- Test fixtures and data in `cypress/fixtures/` directory

**Testing Framework Requirements:**
- Cypress with TypeScript configuration
- Page Object Model pattern for maintainable test structure
- Data-driven testing using fixtures and test data factory
- Screenshot and video capture for test failures

**Testing Patterns:**
- Follow existing test naming conventions from QARvGut.Tests project
- Use existing TestDataFactory patterns for consistent test data
- Implement test isolation and cleanup matching existing patterns
- Align with existing authorization testing approaches

**Integration Requirements:**
- Must not interfere with existing xUnit test execution
- Should leverage existing test database configuration patterns
- Must integrate with current GitHub Actions workflow structure
- Should respect existing test environment variable patterns
