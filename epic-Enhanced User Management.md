Epic: Enhanced User Management - Brownfield Enhancement
Epic Goal
Enhance the existing user management system in QARvGut with advanced user administration capabilities, including user profile management, department organization, activity tracking, and bulk user operations for improved administrative efficiency.

Epic Description
Existing System Context:

Current relevant functionality: Basic user authentication, role-based access (Assessor, Manager, Admin), user entities with Entity Framework
Technology stack: Angular frontend, .NET Core API, PostgreSQL database, existing authorization framework
Integration points: Existing User entity and authentication system, role-based authorization, Angular routing and components
Enhancement Details:

What's being added/changed: Advanced user administration features including detailed user profiles, department management, user activity tracking, bulk operations, and enhanced user search/filtering
How it integrates: Extends existing User entity and authentication system, adds new admin-only UI components, leverages current role-based authorization
Success criteria: Admins can efficiently manage large numbers of users; user profiles contain comprehensive information; activity tracking provides audit capabilities; bulk operations reduce administrative overhead
Stories
Story 1: Enhanced User Data Model - Extend User entity with profile fields (department, contact info, preferences), activity tracking, and bulk operation support with corresponding API endpoints
Story 2: Advanced User Administration API - Implement bulk user operations (import/export, bulk role changes, bulk activation/deactivation) and advanced search/filtering capabilities
Story 3: User Management Dashboard - Create comprehensive Angular admin interface for user management with profile editing, activity tracking, search/filter, and bulk operations
Compatibility Requirements
✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (existing User endpoints preserved)
✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (extend User table, add new optional fields)
✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (Angular admin components, existing styling framework)
✅ Performance impact is minimal (indexed searches, paginated results, efficient bulk operations)
Risk Mitigation
Primary Risk: Database schema changes could impact existing user authentication and authorization
Mitigation: Use database migrations with backward compatibility; extensive testing of existing auth flows; feature flags for new capabilities
Rollback Plan: Database migrations can be rolled back; new UI components can be disabled via feature flags; existing user management remains functional
Definition of Done
✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
✅ Existing functionality verified through testing (login, role authorization, existing user operations work)
✅ Integration points working correctly (authentication, authorization, user entity relationships)
✅ Documentation updated appropriately (API docs, admin user guide, database schema docs)
✅ No regression in existing features (existing authentication and authorization tests pass)
Validation Checklist
Scope Validation:

✅ Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
✅ No architectural documentation is required (extends existing user management)
✅ Enhancement follows existing patterns (Entity Framework extensions, Angular admin components)
✅ Integration complexity is manageable (builds on existing User entity and auth system)
Risk Assessment:

✅ Risk to existing system is low (extends existing functionality, preserves current contracts)
✅ Rollback plan is feasible (database rollback, feature flags, graceful degradation)
✅ Testing approach covers existing functionality (auth regression testing, user management verification)
✅ Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (existing User entity, auth patterns)
Completeness Check:

✅ Epic goal is clear and achievable
✅ Stories are properly scoped (data model, API layer, UI layer)
✅ Success criteria are measurable (admin efficiency, profile completeness, audit capabilities)
✅ Dependencies are identified (existing User entity, auth system, Angular admin components)
Story Manager Handoff
Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

This is an enhancement to an existing system running Angular/.NET Core/PostgreSQL with established user authentication and role management
Integration points: Existing User entity and authentication system, role-based authorization framework, Angular admin routing and components
Existing patterns to follow: Entity Framework model extensions with migrations, .NET Core API controllers with authorization attributes, Angular admin components with form validation
Critical compatibility requirements: Must preserve existing authentication flows, maintain current User entity contracts, follow existing admin UI patterns, ensure backward compatibility of database changes
Each story must include verification that existing login, authentication, and role-based authorization continue to function properly
The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering comprehensive user administration capabilities that scale with the organization's growth."
