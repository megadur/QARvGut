Epic: PDF Document Viewer - Brownfield Enhancement
Epic Goal
Add secure PDF document viewing capabilities to the existing QARvGut system, enabling assessors to view and navigate PDF documents directly within the web application without requiring external plugins or downloads.

Epic Description
Existing System Context:

Current relevant functionality: User authentication, role management, basic CRUD operations with Entity Framework
Technology stack: Angular frontend, .NET Core API, PostgreSQL database, existing file storage capabilities
Integration points: User authentication system, file storage service, existing Angular components and routing
Enhancement Details:

What's being added/changed: PDF viewing capability using PDF.js library integrated into Angular frontend
How it integrates: Leverages existing authentication for secure access, uses current file storage for PDF retrieval, integrates with existing Angular routing and component structure
Success criteria: Users can view PDF documents in-browser with zoom, pan, and page navigation controls; secure access based on user roles; performance meets target load times (<5 seconds)
Stories
Story 1: PDF Document Storage and Security - Implement secure PDF file upload, storage, and retrieval API endpoints with role-based access control
Story 2: PDF Viewer Component - Create Angular component using PDF.js for in-browser PDF viewing with navigation controls (zoom, pan, page navigation)
Story 3: PDF Document Integration - Integrate PDF viewer with existing assignment/document management system and routing
Compatibility Requirements
✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (new endpoints added only)
✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (new tables/fields only)
✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (Angular component architecture)
✅ Performance impact is minimal (lazy loading, optimized rendering)
Risk Mitigation
Primary Risk: PDF rendering performance could impact browser performance with large files
Mitigation: Implement lazy loading, chunked rendering, and file size limits; use PDF.js optimization techniques
Rollback Plan: PDF viewing endpoints can be disabled via feature flag; fallback to download-only functionality
Definition of Done
✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
✅ Existing functionality verified through testing (user auth, existing CRUD operations work)
✅ Integration points working correctly (file storage, authentication, routing)
✅ Documentation updated appropriately (API docs, component docs)
✅ No regression in existing features (existing tests pass)
Validation Checklist
Scope Validation:

✅ Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
✅ No architectural documentation is required (follows existing patterns)
✅ Enhancement follows existing patterns (Angular components, .NET API controllers)
✅ Integration complexity is manageable (existing auth, storage, routing)
Risk Assessment:

✅ Risk to existing system is low (additive functionality only)
✅ Rollback plan is feasible (feature flags, separate endpoints)
✅ Testing approach covers existing functionality (regression testing)
✅ Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (existing patterns)
Completeness Check:

✅ Epic goal is clear and achievable
✅ Stories are properly scoped (backend, frontend, integration)
✅ Success criteria are measurable (performance, functionality)
✅ Dependencies are identified (PDF.js, existing auth/storage)
Story Manager Handoff
Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

This is an enhancement to an existing system running Angular/.NET Core/PostgreSQL
Integration points: User authentication system, existing file storage service, Angular routing and component architecture
Existing patterns to follow: Angular component structure, .NET Core API controllers, Entity Framework models, role-based authorization
Critical compatibility requirements: Must not break existing authentication, maintain current API contracts, follow existing Angular component patterns
Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact
The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering secure, performant PDF viewing capabilities integrated with the existing assessment management workflow."
