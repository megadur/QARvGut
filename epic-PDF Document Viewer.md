# Epic: Assignment & Document Management - Core Platform Features

Epic Goal
Implement the core assignment and document management capabilities for the rvGutachten platform, enabling assessors to view assignments, access PDF documents with in-browser viewing, and track assignment progress through the complete workflow.

Epic Description
Platform Context:

Platform purpose: rvGutachten assessment management platform for efficient assignment workflow and document review
Technology stack: Angular 19 SPA, .NET Core 9.0 API, PostgreSQL database, PDF.js for document viewing, secure file storage
Core capabilities: Assignment dashboard, PDF document viewing, assignment status tracking, document-assignment associations
Platform Scope:

What's being built: Complete assignment and document management system with PDF viewing, status tracking, and workflow management
Success criteria: Assessors can view assignments and browse PDF documents; PDF viewing works reliably across browsers; assignment status tracking functional; performance targets met (<3 seconds page load, <5 seconds PDF rendering)
Primary Users: Assessors (document review), Managers (assignment oversight), Admins (system management)

Stories
Story 1: Assignment Data Model & Dashboard - Implement Assignment and Document entities with REST API endpoints, and create assessor assignment dashboard with status tracking
Story 2: PDF Document Storage & Viewing - Implement secure PDF upload/storage system and create Angular PDF viewer component using PDF.js with navigation controls
Story 3: Assignment-Document Integration - Integrate PDF viewer with assignment workflow, implement assignment status updates, and create manager assignment creation interface

Platform Requirements
✅ Assignment management (create, view, update status, track progress)
✅ PDF document viewing (in-browser, zoom, pan, navigation, secure access)
✅ Assignment-document associations (multiple documents per assignment)
✅ Status tracking (New, Assigned, InProgress, PendingReview, Completed, Signed)
✅ Role-based access (assessors view assignments, managers create/manage)
✅ Performance compliance (page loads <3s, PDF rendering <5s)

Technical Implementation
Database: Assignment and Document entities with proper relationships and indexing
API: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations with role-based authorization
Frontend: Angular dashboard components with responsive design and PDF.js integration
File Storage: Secure PDF storage with access logging and cloud/local options
Security: Role-based access control, secure file serving, input validation

Definition of Done
✅ Assignment dashboard functional for assessors (view, track status)
✅ Manager assignment creation and management interface operational
✅ PDF viewing works reliably across target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
✅ Assignment status tracking through complete workflow
✅ Document-assignment associations working correctly
✅ Performance targets achieved (page loads <3s, PDF rendering <5s)
✅ Security requirements met (role-based access, secure file storage)
✅ 95% test coverage for assignment and document components

Validation Checklist
Platform Alignment:

✅ Epic aligns with PRD Phase 1 Sprint 2 and Phase 2 Sprint 3 requirements

✅ Supports messaging system integration in subsequent epic
✅ PDF viewing capability supports assessment workflow

Technical Validation:

✅ Database schema supports complex assignment-document relationships
✅ PDF.js integration follows best practices for performance
✅ API design supports future messaging and notification features
✅ File storage strategy scales with document volume growth

Success Metrics:

✅ Assessors can view and manage assignments (acceptance criteria met)
✅ PDF viewing performance meets targets across browsers
✅ Assignment workflow supports complete assessment process
✅ Manager oversight capabilities functional
✅ Stories are properly scoped (backend, frontend, integration)
✅ Success criteria are measurable (performance, functionality)
✅ Dependencies are identified (PDF.js, existing auth/storage)
Story Manager Handoff
Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

This is an enhancement to an existing system running Angular/.NET Core/PostgreSQL
Integration points: User authentication system, existing file storage service, Angular routing and component architecture
Existing patterns to follow: Angular component structure, .NET Core API controllers, Entity Framework models, role-based authorization
Critical compatibility requirements: Must not break existing authentication, maintain current API contracts, follow existing Angular component patterns
Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact
The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering secure, performant PDF viewing capabilities integrated with the existing assessment management workflow."
