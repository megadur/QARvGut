# Story 1: User Data Model & Authentication API - Foundation Platform

## User Story

As a **Platform Administrator**,
I want **a comprehensive user authentication system with multi-role support and detailed user profiles**,
So that **the rvGutachten platform can securely manage assessors, managers, and admins with appropriate access controls and user information**.

## Story Context

**Platform Foundation:**

- Platform: New rvGutachten assessment management platform (greenfield development)
- Technology: Angular 19 SPA, .NET Core 9.0 Web API, PostgreSQL database, Entity Framework Core
- Architecture: Clean architecture with JWT authentication, role-based authorization
- Integration: Foundation for assignment management, document viewing, and messaging systems

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. User entity implemented with comprehensive profile fields (id, email, firstName, lastName, role, department, phone, preferences, isActive, lastLogin, createdAt)
2. Multi-role authentication system supporting Assessor, Manager, and Admin roles with appropriate permissions
3. JWT authentication API endpoints (register, login, refresh token, logout) with secure token management
4. Role-based authorization middleware protecting API endpoints based on user roles
5. Password security implementation (hashing, validation, complexity requirements)
6. User profile management API (create, read, update profile information)

**Security Requirements:**

7. JWT token implementation with appropriate expiration and refresh mechanisms
8. Password hashing using industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt/Argon2)
9. Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
10. SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries and Entity Framework
11. HTTPS enforcement and secure cookie management

**Data Requirements:**

12. PostgreSQL database schema with User table and appropriate indexes
13. Entity Framework Core models and DbContext configuration
14. Database migrations for User table creation and initial data seeding
15. User role enumeration (Assessor, Manager, Admin) with permission mapping

## Technical Notes

- **Architecture Pattern:** Clean Architecture with API controllers, services, and Entity Framework repositories
- **Authentication Strategy:** JWT tokens with role-based claims for authorization
- **Database Design:** User entity with profile fields supporting assessment workflow requirements
- **Security Compliance:** HTTPS, input validation, secure password storage, token security

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User entity and database schema implemented with all required fields
- [ ] JWT authentication API endpoints functional (register, login, refresh, logout)
- [ ] Role-based authorization middleware protecting API endpoints
- [ ] Password security implementation with hashing and validation
- [ ] User profile management API endpoints operational
- [ ] Database migrations created and tested
- [ ] Unit tests covering authentication logic (90% coverage target)
- [ ] API documentation for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Security validation (HTTPS, input validation, SQL injection prevention)

## Platform Integration

**Foundation for Subsequent Features:**

- **Assignment Management:** User roles determine assignment access and creation permissions
- **Document Viewing:** User authentication required for secure PDF access
- **Messaging System:** User identity required for message threading and delivery
- **Admin Features:** Admin role enables user management and system oversight

**API Endpoints to Implement:**

- POST /api/auth/register - User registration with role assignment
- POST /api/auth/login - User authentication with JWT token response
- POST /api/auth/refresh - Token refresh for session management
- POST /api/auth/logout - Secure logout with token invalidation
- GET /api/users/profile - User profile retrieval
- PUT /api/users/profile - User profile updates
- GET /api/users (Admin only) - User management list
- POST /api/users (Admin only) - Administrative user creation

## Estimated Effort

- **Development:** 3-4 days
- **Testing:** 2 days
- **Documentation:** 1 day
- **Total:** 6-7 days

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites:** Database setup, .NET Core project initialization, Entity Framework configuration
- **Dependents:** All subsequent stories requiring authentication and user management

## Success Criteria

- Users can register accounts with appropriate role assignment
- Authentication system provides secure login with JWT tokens
- Role-based authorization protects API endpoints correctly
- User profiles support comprehensive information required for assessment workflows
- Foundation supports all planned platform features (assignments, documents, messaging)
