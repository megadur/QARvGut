# Story 1: Enhanced User Data Model - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **System Administrator**,
I want **extended user profile fields and activity tracking in the database**,
So that **I can store comprehensive user information and maintain audit trails for compliance and better user management**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing User entity in QARvGut.Core, ApplicationDbContext, and current authentication system
- Technology: Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL, .NET Core models
- Follows pattern: Existing entity model extensions with database migrations
- Touch points: User entity, authentication middleware, existing user API endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. User entity extended with additional profile fields (Department, Phone, ContactInfo, Preferences JSON field)
2. Activity tracking fields added (LastLoginDate, LoginCount, CreatedDate, ModifiedDate, IsActive)
3. Database migration created that adds new fields without breaking existing data
4. API endpoints extended to support new fields with backward compatibility

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing authentication and user management functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New fields follow existing Entity Framework model pattern with proper annotations
7. Integration with existing ApplicationDbContext maintains current behavior and relationships

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Database migration is tested with existing data scenarios
9. API documentation updated to reflect new fields
10. Existing user-related tests continue to pass without modification

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing User entity using Entity Framework migrations, preserve all existing fields and relationships
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current entity model patterns in QARvGut.Core/Models/Account/
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain backward compatibility with existing authentication flows and API contracts

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User entity extended with new profile and activity tracking fields
- [ ] Database migration created and tested
- [ ] Existing authentication functionality verified working
- [ ] API endpoints support new fields with proper validation
- [ ] All existing user-related tests pass
- [ ] Database schema documentation updated

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Database schema changes could break existing authentication or user queries
- **Mitigation:** Use additive-only migrations, extensive testing of auth flows, feature flags for new fields
- **Rollback:** Database migration can be rolled back, new fields are optional and nullable

**Compatibility Verification:**

- ✅ No breaking changes to existing User APIs
- ✅ Database changes are additive only (new nullable fields)
- ✅ Follows existing Entity Framework patterns
- ✅ Performance impact is negligible (indexed new fields if needed)

## Story Dependencies

- **Prerequisites:** None (foundation story)
- **Dependents:** Story 2 (API needs extended data model), Story 3 (UI needs complete data model)

## Estimated Effort

- **Development:** 1-2 days
- **Testing:** 1 day
- **Total:** 2-3 days
