# Story 3: User Management Dashboard - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **System Administrator**,
I want **a comprehensive Angular user management interface**,
So that **I can efficiently perform user administration tasks including profile editing, activity monitoring, and bulk operations through an intuitive web interface**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing Angular admin components, routing, and HTTP services
- Technology: Angular with existing UI component library, HTTP client, and routing framework
- Follows pattern: Existing admin component structure with forms, tables, and navigation
- Touch points: Angular admin routing, existing HTTP services, UI component patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. User management dashboard component with user list, search/filter controls, and pagination
2. User profile editing form component with validation for new extended fields
3. Activity tracking display showing login history and user statistics
4. Bulk operations interface for import/export, bulk role changes, and bulk activation controls

**Integration Requirements:**

1. Existing Angular admin navigation and routing continue to work unchanged
2. New components follow existing Angular component patterns and styling framework
3. Integration with existing HTTP services maintains current authentication headers and error handling

**Quality Requirements:**

1. Responsive design works on desktop and tablet devices
2. Form validation follows existing Angular validation patterns
3. Loading states and error handling match existing admin component behavior

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create new admin components following existing Angular patterns, integrate with current routing and service structure
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow existing admin component patterns in QARvGut.client/src/app/ admin modules
- **Key Constraints:** Must use existing styling framework, follow current component architecture

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User management dashboard component implemented and functional
- [ ] Profile editing forms working with proper validation
- [ ] Activity tracking display showing user statistics
- [ ] Bulk operations interface integrated with API endpoints
- [ ] Existing admin navigation and components continue to work
- [ ] UI follows existing design patterns and responsive requirements

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** New UI components could conflict with existing admin styling or navigation
- **Mitigation:** Follow existing component patterns exactly, test integration with current admin modules
- **Rollback:** New components can be disabled via routing configuration, existing admin interface unaffected

**Compatibility Verification:**

- ✅ Uses existing Angular component architecture
- ✅ Follows current styling and UI patterns
- ✅ Integrates with existing routing and navigation
- ✅ No impact on existing admin functionality

## Story Dependencies

- **Prerequisites:** Story 1 (needs extended data model) and Story 2 (needs API endpoints)
- **Dependents:** None (final story in epic)

## Estimated Effort

- **Development:** 3-4 days
- **Testing:** 1-2 days
- **Total:** 4-6 days

## UI Mockup Requirements

**Dashboard Layout:**
- User list table with sortable columns
- Search/filter controls in sidebar or top bar
- Pagination controls at bottom
- Action buttons for bulk operations

**Profile Edit Form:**
- Modal or separate page for user editing
- Form sections: Basic Info, Contact Details, Department, Preferences
- Validation messages following existing patterns
- Save/Cancel/Delete actions

**Activity Tracking:**
- User statistics cards or widgets
- Login history table
- Activity timeline if applicable
- Export functionality for audit reports
