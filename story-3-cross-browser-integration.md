## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** QA Engineer and DevOps Engineer,  
**I want** comprehensive cross-browser compatibility tests, API integration validation, performance testing, and regression test coverage,  
**so that** the application works reliably across all supported browsers and maintains quality standards during continuous deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing**
   - Test execution across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
   - Browser-specific functionality and rendering validation
   - Mobile and responsive design testing on different viewports

2. **API Integration Testing**
   - Frontend-backend communication validation for all API endpoints
   - Authentication and authorization testing across different scenarios
   - Error handling and edge case testing for API interactions

3. **Performance Testing & Monitoring**
   - Page load time validation (target: <3 seconds)
   - User interaction responsiveness testing
   - Performance regression detection and reporting

4. **Regression Testing Suite**
   - Existing functionality preservation validation
   - Database migration and schema change testing
   - Backward compatibility verification for API changes

5. **Test Reporting & Analytics**
   - Comprehensive test reports with failure analysis
   - Screenshot and video capture for debugging
   - Performance metrics and trend analysis

6. **Production Readiness Validation**
   - Load testing for concurrent user scenarios
   - Security testing for authentication and authorization
   - Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information

**Cross-Browser Testing Requirements:**

**Browser Support Matrix:**
- Chrome 90+ (Primary development browser)
- Firefox 88+ (Secondary browser support)
- Safari 14+ (macOS and iOS compatibility)
- Edge 90+ (Windows compatibility)
- Mobile browsers (Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile)

**Existing Performance Requirements:**
- Page load times <3 seconds (from PRD)
- User interaction responsiveness <1 second
- PDF rendering <5 seconds
- 99.5% uptime target

**API Integration Points:**
- Authentication API endpoints (JWT/OAuth2)
- User management API (bulk operations, search, filtering)
- Assignment workflow API (status transitions, notifications)
- Document management API (upload, viewing, access control)
- Real-time messaging API (SignalR WebSocket connections)

**Regression Testing Scope:**
- Existing authentication and authorization functionality
- User management features from Story 1.1
- Database schema and migration compatibility
- API endpoint backward compatibility
- Angular component and routing functionality

### Testing Infrastructure

**Cross-Browser Test Execution:**

```yaml
# cypress.config.ts browser configurations
browsers: [
  { name: 'chrome', family: 'chromium' },
  { name: 'firefox', family: 'firefox' },
  { name: 'safari', family: 'webkit' },
  { name: 'edge', family: 'chromium' }
]

viewports: [
  { width: 1920, height: 1080 }, # Desktop
  { width: 1366, height: 768 },  # Laptop
  { width: 768, height: 1024 },  # Tablet
  { width: 375, height: 667 }    # Mobile
]
```

**Performance Testing Configuration:**
- Lighthouse CI integration for Core Web Vitals
- Custom performance metrics collection
- Performance budget enforcement
- Regression detection thresholds

**Load Testing Setup:**
- K6 or Artillery integration for load testing
- Concurrent user simulation (500+ users)
- API endpoint stress testing
- Database performance under load

### Testing Standards

**Test File Organization:**
