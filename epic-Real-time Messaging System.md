# Epic: Messaging & Notifications - Communication Platform

Epic Goal
Implement comprehensive messaging and notification capabilities for the rvGutachten platform, enabling real-time communication between assessors, managers, and admins with document-specific threading, message history, and instant notifications for efficient assessment collaboration.

Epic Description
Platform Context:

Platform purpose: Complete rvGutachten communication system supporting assessment workflow collaboration
Technology stack: Angular 19 SPA, .NET Core 9.0 API with SignalR, PostgreSQL database, WebSocket connections for real-time updates
Core capabilities: Document-specific messaging, general communication, real-time notifications, message threading, email integration
Platform Scope:

What's being built: Full messaging and notification system with real-time delivery, threading, history, and multi-channel notifications
Success criteria: Users can send/receive real-time messages; document-specific threading functional; notification system operational; email integration working; message search and history available
Primary Users: All platform users requiring communication about assignments and documents

Stories
Story 1: Message Data Model & Threading - Implement Message entity with document/assignment linking, REST API endpoints for message CRUD, and message threading/history capabilities
Story 2: Real-time Communication Infrastructure - Implement SignalR hub for instant message delivery, WebSocket connection management, and user presence/notification system
Story 3: Messaging Interface & Notifications - Create Angular messaging components with chat interface, notification center, email integration, and message search functionality

Platform Requirements
✅ Document-specific messaging (link messages to assignments and documents)
✅ Real-time communication (instant message delivery via SignalR/WebSocket)
✅ Message threading and history (organized conversation threads)
✅ Multi-channel notifications (in-app, email, browser notifications)
✅ Message search and filtering (find messages by content, user, document)
✅ User presence indicators (online/offline status, typing indicators)
✅ Email notification integration (configurable notification preferences)

Technical Implementation
Database: Message entity with assignment/document relationships, full-text search indexing
Real-time: SignalR hubs with connection grouping and authentication
Frontend: Angular components with real-time updates, notification center, message composition
Email: SMTP integration for email notifications with templating system
Security: Message authorization, secure WebSocket connections, input sanitization

Definition of Done
✅ Document-specific messaging functional with assignment/document threading
✅ Real-time message delivery working via SignalR across browser sessions
✅ Message history and search capabilities operational
✅ Notification system working (in-app, email, browser notifications)
✅ User presence and typing indicators functional
✅ Email notification integration with user preferences
✅ Message authorization and security controls working
✅ Performance targets met (message delivery <1s, notification latency <2s)

Validation Checklist
Platform Alignment:

✅ Epic aligns with PRD Phase 2 Sprint 4 and Sprint 5 requirements
✅ Builds upon user management and assignment systems
✅ Integrates with document viewing for contextual messaging
✅ Supports complete assessment workflow communication needs

Technical Validation:

✅ SignalR implementation supports concurrent user load (500+ users)
✅ Message threading provides clear conversation context
✅ Notification system handles multiple delivery channels
✅ Database design supports efficient message search and retrieval

Success Metrics:

✅ Users can communicate effectively about assignments and documents
✅ Real-time delivery maintains responsive user experience
✅ Notification system reduces communication delays by 50%
✅ Message search helps users find relevant conversations quickly
✅ Stories are properly scoped (data layer, real-time layer, UI layer)
✅ Success criteria are measurable (real-time delivery, threading, notifications)
✅ Dependencies are identified (SignalR, existing entities, Angular services)
Story Manager Handoff
Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

This is an enhancement to an existing system running Angular/.NET Core/PostgreSQL with existing user and assignment management
Integration points: User authentication system, existing User and Assignment entities, Angular component architecture, role-based authorization
Existing patterns to follow: Entity Framework models with relationships, .NET Core API controllers, Angular services with observables, existing authorization attributes
Critical compatibility requirements: Must integrate with existing User/Assignment entities, maintain current authentication flow, follow existing Angular component patterns
Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact
The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering real-time messaging capabilities that enhance collaboration within the existing assessment workflow."
