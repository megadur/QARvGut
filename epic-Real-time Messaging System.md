Epic: Real-time Messaging System - Brownfield Enhancement
Epic Goal
Implement a real-time messaging system within the existing QARvGut application, enabling assessors, managers, and admins to communicate about assignments and documents through instant messaging with proper threading and notification capabilities.

Epic Description
Existing System Context:

Current relevant functionality: User authentication with roles (Assessor, Manager, Admin), assignment management, user management with Entity Framework
Technology stack: Angular frontend, .NET Core API with SignalR capability, PostgreSQL database, existing authorization framework
Integration points: User authentication system, existing role-based authorization, assignment entities, Angular services and components
Enhancement Details:

What's being added/changed: Real-time messaging system with document/assignment threading, message history, and instant notifications using SignalR
How it integrates: Leverages existing user and assignment entities, uses current authentication for secure messaging, integrates with existing Angular component architecture
Success criteria: Users can send/receive messages in real-time; messages can be tied to assignments/documents; message history is preserved; notifications work across browser tabs
Stories
Story 1: Message Data Model and API - Create message entities, database schema, and REST API endpoints for message CRUD operations with assignment/document linking
Story 2: Real-time Communication Hub - Implement SignalR hub for real-time message delivery with user connection management and authentication
Story 3: Messaging UI Components - Create Angular messaging interface with chat threads, message composition, and real-time updates
Compatibility Requirements
✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (new endpoints added only)
✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (new Message table and relationships)
✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (Angular component architecture, existing styling)
✅ Performance impact is minimal (efficient SignalR connections, message pagination)
Risk Mitigation
Primary Risk: SignalR connections could impact server performance with concurrent users
Mitigation: Implement connection pooling, message batching, and connection limits; use groups for efficient message routing
Rollback Plan: SignalR hub can be disabled via configuration; fallback to polling-based messaging or email notifications
Definition of Done
✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
✅ Existing functionality verified through testing (user auth, assignments, existing features work)
✅ Integration points working correctly (user roles, assignment linking, real-time delivery)
✅ Documentation updated appropriately (API docs, SignalR setup, component usage)
✅ No regression in existing features (existing tests pass, performance maintained)
Validation Checklist
Scope Validation:

✅ Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
✅ No architectural documentation is required (extends existing patterns)
✅ Enhancement follows existing patterns (.NET controllers, Angular services, Entity Framework)
✅ Integration complexity is manageable (existing auth, user/assignment entities)
Risk Assessment:

✅ Risk to existing system is low (additive functionality, separate SignalR hub)
✅ Rollback plan is feasible (configuration toggle, graceful degradation)
✅ Testing approach covers existing functionality (regression testing, performance monitoring)
✅ Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (existing user/assignment models)
Completeness Check:

✅ Epic goal is clear and achievable
✅ Stories are properly scoped (data layer, real-time layer, UI layer)
✅ Success criteria are measurable (real-time delivery, threading, notifications)
✅ Dependencies are identified (SignalR, existing entities, Angular services)
Story Manager Handoff
Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

This is an enhancement to an existing system running Angular/.NET Core/PostgreSQL with existing user and assignment management
Integration points: User authentication system, existing User and Assignment entities, Angular component architecture, role-based authorization
Existing patterns to follow: Entity Framework models with relationships, .NET Core API controllers, Angular services with observables, existing authorization attributes
Critical compatibility requirements: Must integrate with existing User/Assignment entities, maintain current authentication flow, follow existing Angular component patterns
Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact
The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering real-time messaging capabilities that enhance collaboration within the existing assessment workflow."
