# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Risks

- **PDF Rendering Performance**: Large PDF files may cause browser performance issues
  - *Mitigation*: Implement lazy loading, chunked rendering, and PDF.js optimization
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: PDF viewing may vary across browsers
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing on all supported browsers, fallback options
- **File Storage Scalability**: Growing document storage requirements
  - *Mitigation*: Implement cloud storage with CDN, file compression, archival strategy

## Business Risks

- **User Adoption**: Assessors may resist change from current workflows
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive training program, gradual rollout, feedback incorporation
- **Feature Creep**: Stakeholders requesting additional features during development
  - *Mitigation*: Strict change control process, MVP focus, future roadmap communication
- **Integration Complexity**: Challenges integrating with existing admin systems
  - *Mitigation*: Early API design, prototype integration, clear interface contracts

## Resource Risks

- **Development Timeline**: Limited development resources may cause delays
  - *Mitigation*: Realistic sprint planning, regular risk assessment, scope prioritization
- **Budget Constraints**: Project costs may exceed allocated budget
  - *Mitigation*: Regular cost monitoring, phased delivery approach, MVP focus
