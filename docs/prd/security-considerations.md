# Security Considerations

## Authentication & Authorization

- Multi-factor authentication for all user roles
- JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times
- Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- Session management and timeout controls

## Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for all sensitive documents
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS 1.3)
- Secure file storage with access logging
- Data anonymization for analytics
- GDPR compliance for EU users

## Application Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
