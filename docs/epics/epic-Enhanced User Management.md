Epic: Foundation Authentication & User Management - Greenfield Platform
Epic Goal
Establish the foundational authentication and user management system for the new rvGutachten platform, providing secure multi-role access (Assessor, Manager, Admin) with comprehensive user profile management and role-based authorization.

Epic Description
Platform Context:

Platform purpose: New rvGutachten assessment management platform for efficient document review and communication workflows
Technology stack: Angular 19 SPA frontend, .NET Core 9.0 Web API, PostgreSQL database, JWT/OAuth2 authentication
Core capabilities: Multi-role authentication, user profile management, role-based access control, session management
Platform Scope:

What's being built: Complete authentication system with user registration, login, profile management, and role-based authorization framework
Success criteria: Users can register, login, and access role-appropriate features; admin users can manage other users; secure session management; 99.5% authentication success rate
Primary Users: All platform users (Assessors, Managers, Admins) requiring secure access to assessment workflows

Stories
Story 1: User Data Model & Authentication API - Implement User entity with comprehensive profile fields, JWT authentication endpoints, and role-based authorization middleware
Story 2: User Registration & Profile Management - Create user registration, profile editing, and password management capabilities with validation and security controls
Story 3: Admin User Management Interface - Build Angular admin interface for user creation, role assignment, profile management, and user activity monitoring

Platform Requirements
✅ Comprehensive user profiles (firstName, lastName, email, role, department, phone, preferences)
✅ Multi-role support (Assessor, Manager, Admin with appropriate permissions)
✅ Secure authentication (JWT tokens, password hashing, session management)
✅ Admin capabilities (user creation, role management, profile editing, activity tracking)
✅ Security compliance (HTTPS, input validation, SQL injection prevention)

Technical Implementation
Authentication: JWT tokens with appropriate expiration, role-based middleware
Database: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core, User entity with profile fields
Frontend: Angular components with route guards, form validation, responsive design
Security: Password hashing, input sanitization, CSRF protection, secure session management

Definition of Done
✅ All authentication and user management features functional per PRD requirements
✅ Role-based access control working correctly (Assessor, Manager, Admin)
✅ User registration, login, and profile management operational
✅ Admin interface for user management completed
✅ Security requirements met (HTTPS, validation, authorization)
✅ 95% test coverage achieved for authentication components
✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance for user interfaces

Validation Checklist
Platform Alignment:

✅ Epic aligns with PRD Phase 1 Sprint 1 requirements
✅ Foundation supports all subsequent platform features
✅ User model supports assignment and messaging system integration
✅ Authentication framework ready for protected routes and features

Technical Validation:

✅ Database schema supports comprehensive user management
✅ API design follows RESTful patterns with proper authentication
✅ Frontend components follow Angular best practices
✅ Security implementation meets enterprise standards

Success Metrics:

✅ Users can register and login successfully (acceptance criteria met)
✅ Role-based access control functions properly
✅ Admin users can manage other users effectively
✅ Performance meets targets (login <2 seconds, page loads <3 seconds)
✅ Stories are properly scoped (data model, API layer, UI layer)
✅ Success criteria are measurable (admin efficiency, profile completeness, audit capabilities)
✅ Dependencies are identified (existing User entity, auth system, Angular admin components)
Story Manager Handoff
Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

This is an enhancement to an existing system running Angular/.NET Core/PostgreSQL with established user authentication and role management
Integration points: Existing User entity and authentication system, role-based authorization framework, Angular admin routing and components
Existing patterns to follow: Entity Framework model extensions with migrations, .NET Core API controllers with authorization attributes, Angular admin components with form validation
Critical compatibility requirements: Must preserve existing authentication flows, maintain current User entity contracts, follow existing admin UI patterns, ensure backward compatibility of database changes
Each story must include verification that existing login, authentication, and role-based authorization continue to function properly
The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering comprehensive user administration capabilities that scale with the organization's growth."
