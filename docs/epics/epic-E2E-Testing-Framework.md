# Epic: End-to-End Testing Framework - Quality Assurance Platform

## Epic Goal

Establish comprehensive end-to-end testing infrastructure for the QARvGut platform to ensure reliable user journeys, cross-browser compatibility, and system integration validation across all critical workflows and user scenarios.

## Epic Description

**Platform Context:**

- **Platform purpose:** Comprehensive e2e testing framework for rvGutachten assessment management platform
- **Technology stack:** Cypress/Playwright testing framework, Angular 19 SPA frontend, .NET Core 9.0 Web API, PostgreSQL database
- **Core capabilities:** Automated user journey testing, cross-browser validation, API integration testing, performance monitoring, regression testing
- **Platform Scope:** Complete testing coverage from user authentication through assessment workflow completion

**What's being built:** End-to-end testing framework with automated test suites covering critical user journeys, cross-browser compatibility validation, API integration testing, and continuous testing pipeline integration

**Success criteria:**

- Critical user journeys automated with 95% reliability
- Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- API integration tests validate frontend-backend communication
- Test execution time under 30 minutes for full suite
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for automated regression testing

**Primary Users:** QA Engineers, Developers, DevOps Engineers requiring comprehensive testing validation before deployments

## Stories

**Story 1: E2E Testing Framework Setup & Infrastructure**
Implement Cypress/Playwright testing framework with project configuration, test data management, and CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution

**Story 2: Critical User Journey Test Automation**
Create automated test suites covering core user workflows including authentication, user management, assignment handling, document viewing, and messaging functionality

**Story 3: Cross-Browser & Integration Testing Suite**
Develop cross-browser compatibility tests, API integration validation, performance testing, and comprehensive regression test coverage for existing functionality

## Platform Requirements

✅ **E2E Testing Framework** (Cypress or Playwright with TypeScript configuration)
✅ **Test Data Management** (Automated test data setup/teardown, database seeding)
✅ **Critical Journey Coverage** (Authentication, user management, assignments, document viewing, messaging)
✅ **Cross-Browser Testing** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility validation)
✅ **API Integration Testing** (Frontend-backend communication validation)
✅ **Performance Testing** (Page load times, user interaction responsiveness)
✅ **Regression Testing** (Existing functionality preservation validation)
✅ **CI/CD Integration** (Automated test execution in deployment pipeline)

## Technical Implementation

**Testing Framework:** Cypress or Playwright with TypeScript, Page Object Model pattern
**Test Data:** Automated database seeding with realistic test scenarios
**Browser Support:** Headless and headed testing across major browsers
**Integration:** GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline integration
**Reporting:** Comprehensive test reports with screenshots and video recording
**Environment:** Dedicated testing environment with isolated test data

## Definition of Done

✅ E2E testing framework operational with Cypress/Playwright configuration
✅ Critical user journeys automated (authentication, user management, assignments, documents, messaging)
✅ Cross-browser compatibility validated across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
✅ API integration tests validate frontend-backend communication
✅ Test data management system provides consistent, isolated test scenarios
✅ Performance testing validates page load times and user interaction responsiveness

## Validation Checklist

**Platform Alignment:**

✅ Epic aligns with PRD testing strategy requirements for comprehensive e2e coverage
✅ Supports all platform user roles (Assessor, Manager, Admin) and their workflows
✅ Validates integration between Angular frontend and .NET Core API
✅ Ensures quality gates before production deployments

**Technical Validation:**

✅ Testing framework integrates with existing Angular 19 and .NET Core 9.0 stack
✅ Test data management respects existing PostgreSQL database schema
✅ Cross-browser testing covers primary user environments
✅ Performance testing validates against defined SLA requirements (page loads <3s)

**Success Metrics:**

✅ Critical user journeys execute reliably with 95% success rate
✅ Test suite identifies integration issues before production deployment
✅ Cross-browser compatibility ensures consistent user experience
✅ Regression testing prevents existing functionality breakage
✅ Stories are properly scoped (framework setup, journey automation, cross-browser validation)
✅ Success criteria are measurable (execution time, coverage percentage, reliability metrics)
✅ Dependencies identified (existing test infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, test environments)

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this e2e testing epic. Key considerations:

- This enhances an existing system running Angular/.NET Core/PostgreSQL with established user authentication, role management, and assessment workflows
- **Integration points:** Existing unit/integration test infrastructure, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, test database configuration
- **Existing patterns to follow:** xUnit testing patterns for .NET Core, Angular testing with Jasmine/Jest, existing test data factory patterns
- **Critical compatibility requirements:** Must integrate with existing testing infrastructure, maintain test isolation, follow established CI/CD patterns
- **Each story must include:** Framework selection justification, test data strategy, CI/CD integration approach, and validation that existing test infrastructure remains functional
- **The epic should:** Provide comprehensive e2e coverage while complementing existing unit/integration tests and ensuring reliable quality gates for production deployments"

**Key Dependencies:**

- Existing test infrastructure (QARvGut.Tests project)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Test database and data management strategy
- Angular client testing configuration
- Existing authentication and authorization test patterns

**Integration Requirements:**

- Must work alongside existing xUnit unit tests and integration tests
- Should leverage existing TestDataFactory for consistent test data
- Must integrate with current GitHub Actions workflow
- Should respect existing database migration and seeding patterns
- Must maintain existing test isolation and cleanup procedures
