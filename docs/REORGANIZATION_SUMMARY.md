# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date:** August 11, 2025  
**Action:** Major documentation restructure for improved organization and navigation  

## Changes Made

### New Folder Structure Created
- `architecture/` - Technical architecture and domain models
- `design/` - UI/UX specifications and assets
  - `design/wireframes/` - Wireframes and layouts
  - `design/images/` - Visual assets and mockups
- `analysis/` - Project analysis and validation
- `reference/` - Reference materials and legacy documents

### Files Moved

#### To `architecture/`
- `brownfield-architecture-enhanced-user-management.md`
- `domain-model-plan.md`
- `domain-model-summary.md`

#### To `design/`
- `document-viewing-interaction-spec.md`
- `design/wireframes/document-viewer-wireframes.md` (moved from root)
- `design/images/rvGut1.png` (moved from root)
- `design/images/rvGut2.png` (moved from root)
- `design/images/rvGut3.png` (moved from root)

#### To `stories/`
- `story-1-e2e-framework-setup.md`
- `story-1-enhanced-user-data-model.md`
- `story-2-advanced-user-admin-api.md`
- `story-2-critical-user-journeys.md`
- `story-3-cross-browser-integration.md`
- `story-3-user-management-dashboard.md`

#### To `analysis/`
- `po-master-checklist-analysis.md`

#### To `reference/`
- `business-objects.csv`
- `rvGutachten_prd.md` → `legacy-prd.md` (renamed)

### Files Created

## Benefits of Reorganization

### Improved Navigation
- Clear categorization by document type and purpose
- Logical folder hierarchy that matches project workflow
- Comprehensive README with role-based navigation guides

### Reduced Clutter
- Root level now contains only major category folders
- Images consolidated into dedicated assets folder
- Legacy/duplicate content clearly marked

### Better Maintainability
- Consistent naming conventions (lowercase, hyphens)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to find related documents

### Enhanced Discoverability
- Role-based quick navigation sections
- Document relationship mapping
- Purpose-clear folder names

## Folder Structure Overview

```
docs/
├── README.md (NEW)
├── prd/ (existing - comprehensive product requirements)
├── brownfield-architecture/ (existing - detailed technical specs)
├── architecture/ (NEW - high-level architecture documents)
├── epics/ (existing - feature epics)
├── stories/ (existing - now contains ALL story files)
├── design/ (NEW - UI/UX specifications and assets)
│   ├── wireframes/
│   └── images/
├── analysis/ (NEW - project analysis documents)
└── reference/ (NEW - reference materials and legacy docs)
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use the README.md** as the entry point for all documentation navigation
2. **Follow the established folder structure** when adding new documents
3. **Update cross-references** in existing documents if they reference moved files
4. **Consider consolidating** the legacy PRD with the structured PRD folder content
5. **Maintain naming consistency** using lowercase with hyphens for new files

## Next Steps

1. Update any broken internal links in documents that reference moved files
2. Consider creating index.md files in each major folder for additional navigation
3. Regular maintenance to ensure new documents are placed in appropriate folders
