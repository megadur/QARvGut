# Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Existing Pattern Preservation:** All new endpoints use existing authorization policies
- **Role-Based Access:** Admin-only operations protected by `AuthPolicies.ManageAllUsersPolicy`
- **Data Protection:** Sensitive profile data access controlled by existing user authorization handlers

### Data Security
- **Profile Data:** Extended profile fields follow existing data protection patterns
- **Activity Tracking:** Login and activity data treated as audit information with appropriate access controls
- **Bulk Operations:** Administrative operations logged and audited

### API Security
- **Input Validation:** All new endpoints follow existing validation patterns via `[SanitizeModel]` attribute
- **Bulk Operation Limits:** File size and record count limits to prevent abuse
- **Rate Limiting:** Inherited from existing API rate limiting configuration
