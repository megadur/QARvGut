# Story E2E.1: Framework Setup - E2E Testing Framework Infrastructure

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** QA Engineer,
**I want** a complete E2E testing framework infrastructure with Cypress/Playwright configuration, test data management, and CI/CD integration,
**so that** I can create and execute automated end-to-end tests for the QARvGut platform with reliable test data and continuous integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Framework Selection & Configuration**
   - Cypress or Playwright framework is installed and configured with TypeScript support
   - Page Object Model pattern is implemented for maintainable test structure
   - Framework integrates seamlessly with existing Angular 19 and .NET Core 9.0 stack
   - Configuration supports both headless and headed test execution modes

2. **Test Data Management System**
   - Automated test database setup/teardown functionality implemented
   - Test data seeding system provides realistic, isolated test scenarios
   - Test data factory integrates with existing TestDataFactory patterns
   - Database state is cleanly reset between test runs

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow configured for automated test execution
   - Tests execute automatically on code changes (pull requests)
   - Test results are reported with clear pass/fail status
   - Integration respects existing CI/CD pipeline structure and patterns

4. **Project Structure & Standards**
   - Test files organized following established project conventions
   - TypeScript configuration aligns with existing project standards
   - Test naming conventions follow existing testing patterns
   - Documentation created for framework usage and test writing guidelines

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Dedicated testing environment configuration established
   - Environment variables and configuration management implemented
   - Test environment isolated from development and production environments
   - Cross-browser testing capabilities configured for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Framework Installation & Initial Configuration** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Evaluate and select between Cypress vs Playwright based on project requirements
  - [ ] Install chosen framework with TypeScript configuration
  - [ ] Configure Page Object Model pattern structure
  - [ ] Set up initial test configuration files

- [ ] **Test Data Management Implementation** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create test database seeding utilities
  - [ ] Implement automated test data setup/teardown system
  - [ ] Integrate with existing QARvGut.Tests TestDataFactory patterns
  - [ ] Create isolated test data scenarios for critical user journeys

- [ ] **CI/CD Integration Setup** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions workflow for E2E test execution
  - [ ] Integrate test execution with existing CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Implement test result reporting and failure notifications
  - [ ] Configure automated test triggers on pull requests

- [ ] **Project Structure & Documentation** (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Organize test file structure following project conventions
  - [ ] Configure environment management for test execution
  - [ ] Create test writing guidelines and framework documentation
  - [ ] Set up cross-browser testing configuration

## Dev Notes

**Existing System Integration:**
- Must integrate with existing QARvGut.Tests project structure and patterns
- Leverage existing TestDataFactory for consistent test data creation
- Respect existing xUnit testing patterns and database migration strategies
- Integration points: Angular client testing setup, .NET Core API test infrastructure

**Technology Stack Context:**
- Angular 19 SPA frontend with existing testing configuration (Jasmine/Jest)
- .NET Core 9.0 Web API with established xUnit testing patterns
- PostgreSQL database with existing migration and seeding patterns
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

**Critical Compatibility Requirements:**
- Framework must coexist with existing unit and integration tests
- Test data management must not interfere with existing test isolation procedures
- CI/CD integration must not disrupt existing GitHub Actions workflows
- Must maintain existing database schema and migration patterns

**Framework Selection Considerations:**
- Cypress: Better debugging experience, real browser testing, established Angular integration
- Playwright: Better cross-browser support, faster execution, better CI/CD integration
- Decision should consider team familiarity and existing Angular testing patterns

### Testing

**Framework Testing Requirements:**
- Test framework installation and configuration verification
- Test data setup/teardown system validation
- CI/CD pipeline integration testing
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

**Testing Standards:**
- E2E tests located in `/e2e` or `/tests/e2e` directory structure
- Follow existing TypeScript configuration and linting standards
- Test file naming: `*.e2e.spec.ts` or `*.e2e.test.ts`
- Page Object files: `*.page.ts` in dedicated `pages` directory
- Test data fixtures in `fixtures` directory with TypeScript typing
