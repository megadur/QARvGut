## User Story

As a **Platform User (Assessor/Manager/Admin)**,
I want **user registration, profile management, and secure authentication capabilities**,
So that **I can create my account, manage my profile information, and securely access the rvGutachten platform with appropriate role-based permissions**.

1. User registration form with validation (email, password, firstName, lastName, role selection)
2. Email validation and uniqueness checking
3. Password strength validation with clear requirements
4. Role assignment during registration (with admin approval for Manager/Admin roles)
5. Registration confirmation system with email verification

**Authentication Interface:**

6. Login form with email/password authentication
7. "Remember me" functionality with secure session management
