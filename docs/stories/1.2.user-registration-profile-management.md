## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.1 completed the backend foundation with:

- Extended ApplicationUser entity with comprehensive profile fields (Department, Phone, ContactInfo, Preferences, LastLoginDate, LoginCount, IsActive, GesperrtSeit, LastLoginIp, Avatar)
- Enhanced UserAccountController with profile update and activity endpoints
- Comprehensive API endpoints for user management and bulk operations
- Complete authentication infrastructure with JWT tokens and role-based authorization

### Frontend Component Specifications

[Source: brownfield-architecture/component-architecture.md#user-management-dashboard-components]

- **Integration Points:** Existing Angular admin routing, HTTP services, Bootstrap styling framework
- **Component Location:** Follow existing component structure in controls folder
- **Patterns:** Extends existing component patterns and follows established admin controls structure

### API Integration Points

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.user-data-model-authentication-api.md#api-specifications]
Available backend endpoints from Story 1.1:

- PUT /api/account/users/{id}/profile - Update extended profile
- GET /api/account/users/{id}/activity - User activity history  
- POST /api/account/users - User registration (existing endpoint)
- Existing login/logout endpoints in authentication flow
- Password reset endpoints in UserAccountController

### File Locations

[Source: brownfield-architecture/development-guidelines.md#code-organization]

- **Frontend Components:** New components in `QARvGut.client/src/app/components/` folder
- **Authentication Services:** Extend existing services in `QARvGut.client/src/app/services/`
- **Routing:** Add routes to existing `QARvGut.client/src/app/app.routes.ts`
- **Models:** Extend existing ViewModels in client-side models

### Technical Constraints

[Source: brownfield-architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]

- **Frontend Framework:** Angular 19 with reactive forms and HTTP client
- **UI Framework:** Bootstrap (existing styling framework in project)
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with existing token management patterns
- **Validation:** Client-side Angular validators + server-side validation consistency

### Security Requirements

[Source: brownfield-architecture/security-considerations.md#authentication-and-authorization]

- **Password Security:** Must integrate with existing ASP.NET Identity password policies
- **Token Management:** Use existing JWT token storage and refresh patterns
- **CSRF Protection:** Angular built-in CSRF protection with existing backend CSRF tokens
- **Session Management:** Follow existing session timeout and cleanup patterns

### Existing Component Patterns

[Source: semantic search results - user-info.component.html and login.component.html]
Current patterns to follow:

- Form validation with `ngModel` and template reference variables
- Bootstrap CSS classes for styling (`form-control`, `is-valid`, `is-invalid`)
- Error message display with conditional rendering using `@if`
- Translation service integration for internationalization
- Responsive design patterns with Bootstrap grid system

### Testing Requirements

[Source: brownfield-architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-integration]

- **Component Testing:** Test new components with existing routing and services
- **Authentication Testing:** Verify integration with existing authentication patterns
- **Form Validation Testing:** Test client-side validation and server-side consistency
- **E2E Testing:** Test complete user registration and profile management workflows
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure WCAG compliance for all new user interfaces
