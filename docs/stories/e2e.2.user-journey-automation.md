# Story E2E.2: Critical User Journey Automation - End-to-End Test Implementation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** QA Engineer,
**I want** automated test suites covering all critical user journeys including authentication, user management, assignment handling, document viewing, and messaging functionality,
**so that** I can validate that core user workflows function correctly across the entire QARvGut platform before each deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Authentication Flow Testing**
   - Complete login/logout test automation for all user roles (Assessor, Manager, Admin)
   - Password reset and account recovery workflow validation
   - Session management and timeout behavior verification
   - Multi-factor authentication flow testing (if implemented)

2. **User Management Workflow Testing**
   - User creation, modification, and deletion workflows automated
   - Role assignment and permission validation testing
   - User profile management and settings workflow validation
   - User search and filtering functionality testing

3. **Assignment Handling Test Coverage**
   - Assignment creation and assignment workflow automation
   - Assignment status transitions and approval processes testing
   - Assignment search, filtering, and sorting functionality validation
   - Assignment document attachment and management testing

4. **Document Viewing Integration Testing**
   - PDF document viewer functionality automated testing
   - Document upload, download, and viewing workflow validation
   - Document annotation and commenting functionality testing
   - Document version control and history tracking validation

5. **Messaging System Test Automation**
   - Real-time messaging functionality automated testing
   - Notification system and delivery validation
   - Message search, filtering, and archiving workflow testing
   - Group messaging and broadcast functionality validation

6. **Cross-Workflow Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end workflows spanning multiple system components
   - Data consistency validation across different user actions
   - Workflow state preservation during user session management
   - Error handling and recovery scenario testing

## Dev Notes

**Critical User Journey Mapping:**

- **Authentication Journey:** Login → Role Validation → Dashboard Access → Session Management → Logout
- **User Management Journey:** Admin Login → User Creation → Role Assignment → Permission Validation → User Modification
- **Assignment Journey:** Manager Login → Assignment Creation → Assessor Assignment → Status Updates → Completion Workflow
- **Document Journey:** User Login → Assignment Access → Document Upload → PDF Viewing → Annotation → Download
- **Messaging Journey:** User Login → Message Creation → Real-time Delivery → Notification → Message Management

**Existing System Integration Points:**

- Angular frontend components: Authentication service, User management, Assignment components, Document viewer, Messaging components
- .NET Core API endpoints: Authentication controller, User controller, Assignment controller, Document controller, Message controller
- Database entities: Users, Roles, Assignments, Documents, Messages, Notifications
- Real-time SignalR connections for messaging and notifications

**Testing Framework Integration:**

- Leverage existing authentication test patterns from QARvGut.Tests
- Use established TestDataFactory for consistent user and assignment data
- Integrate with existing API test patterns for backend validation
- Follow existing Angular component testing patterns for frontend validation

**Data Dependencies:**

- Test users with different roles (Assessor, Manager, Admin) pre-configured
- Sample assignments at different workflow states
- Test documents (PDFs) for document viewer testing
- Message templates and notification scenarios

### Testing

**Test Data Requirements:**

- Pre-configured test users for each role with known credentials
- Sample assignments in various workflow states for testing
- Test PDF documents of different sizes and complexity levels
- Message conversation threads for messaging functionality validation

**Testing Standards:**

- E2E test files organized by user journey: `auth.e2e.spec.ts`, `user-management.e2e.spec.ts`, `assignments.e2e.spec.ts`, `documents.e2e.spec.ts`, `messaging.e2e.spec.ts`
- Page Object Models for each major application area
- Test data setup/teardown for each test suite
- Screenshot capture on test failures for debugging
- Test execution time monitoring to ensure suite stays under 30 minutes

**Performance Considerations:**

- Page load time validation (under 3 seconds per SLA requirements)
- API response time monitoring during E2E flows
- Real-time messaging delivery time validation
- Document viewer loading performance testing
