# Story 2: Advanced User Administration API - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **System Administrator**,
I want **bulk user operations and advanced search capabilities through API endpoints**,
So that **I can efficiently manage large numbers of users with import/export, bulk updates, and sophisticated filtering**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing UserController, authorization attributes, and Entity Framework queries
- Technology: .NET Core Web API, existing authorization framework, Entity Framework queries
- Follows pattern: Existing API controller structure with [Authorize] attributes and response patterns
- Touch points: UserController, existing user API endpoints, role-based authorization middleware

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Bulk operations API endpoints: bulk user import (CSV/JSON), bulk role assignment, bulk activation/deactivation
2. Advanced search/filter API with support for department, role, activity status, date ranges
3. User export API endpoint with filtering capabilities (CSV/JSON formats)
4. Pagination support for large user lists with configurable page sizes

**Integration Requirements:**

1. Existing UserController endpoints continue to work unchanged
2. New endpoints follow existing authorization pattern with [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] attributes
3. Integration with existing Entity Framework context maintains current query patterns

**Quality Requirements:**

1. Bulk operations include proper validation and error handling
2. API documentation updated with new endpoint specifications
3. Performance testing completed for large user datasets (1000+ users)

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add new action methods to existing UserController, follow current authorization and response patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current controller patterns in QARvGut.Server/Controllers/UserAccountController.cs
- **Key Constraints:** Must respect existing role-based authorization, maintain current API versioning approach

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Bulk operation endpoints implemented with proper validation
- [ ] Advanced search/filter functionality working with pagination
- [ ] Export functionality supports multiple formats
- [ ] All endpoints properly authorized and tested
- [ ] Existing user API endpoints continue to function
- [ ] API documentation updated

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Bulk operations could impact database performance or timeout
- **Mitigation:** Implement batch processing, transaction management, and timeout handling
- **Rollback:** New endpoints can be disabled via feature flags, existing APIs unaffected

**Compatibility Verification:**

- ✅ No changes to existing API endpoints
- ✅ Follows existing authorization patterns
- ✅ Uses existing Entity Framework context
- ✅ Performance impact managed through batching and pagination

## Story Dependencies

- **Prerequisites:** Story 1 (Enhanced User Data Model must be completed)
- **Dependents:** Story 3 (UI needs these API endpoints)

## Estimated Effort

- **Development:** 2-3 days
- **Testing:** 1-2 days
- **Total:** 3-5 days
