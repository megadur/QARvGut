# Story 2.1: Critical User Journey Test Automation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** QA Engineer and Developer,  
**I want** automated test suites covering all critical user workflows (authentication, user management, assignments, document viewing, messaging),  
**so that** I can ensure core application functionality works reliably across deployments and prevent regression issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Authentication Journey Testing**
   - User login/logout workflows automated with all user roles (Assessor, Manager, Admin)
   - Registration and password management flows tested
   - Authentication error scenarios and validation testing implemented

2. **User Management Journey Testing**
   - Admin user creation, editing, and role assignment workflows automated
   - User search and filtering functionality tested
   - Bulk operations (import, activation, role assignment) validated

3. **Assignment Workflow Testing**
   - Assignment creation and assignment workflows automated
   - Document upload and association testing implemented
   - Assignment status transitions and notifications tested

4. **Document Viewing Journey Testing**
   - PDF document viewer functionality tested across browsers
   - Document navigation and annotation features validated
   - Document access control and permissions tested

5. **Messaging System Testing**
   - Real-time messaging functionality automated
   - Message threading and conversation management tested
   - Notification delivery and user presence testing implemented

6. **Cross-Role Integration Testing**
   - Multi-user scenarios with different roles tested
   - Workflow handoffs between Assessor, Manager, and Admin validated
   - End-to-end assessment lifecycle testing completed

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information

**Critical User Journeys from Existing Documentation:**

**Authentication System:**
- JWT/OAuth2 implementation in existing backend
- Role-based authorization (Assessor, Manager, Admin)
- User entity with comprehensive profile fields (Story 1.1)
- Authentication API endpoints documented in testing documentation

**User Management Features:**
- Enhanced user management from Story 1.1 implementation
- Bulk operations (import, activation, role assignment)
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Admin interface for user management

**Assignment System (Future Implementation):**
- Assignment entity relationships and workflow logic
- Document association and management
- Status transitions and business rules
- Notification and alert systems

**Document Viewing Capabilities:**
- PDF viewer integration planned
- Document access control and permissions
- Annotation and commenting features
- Cross-browser compatibility requirements

**Messaging Infrastructure:**
- SignalR real-time messaging implementation planned
- Message threading and conversation management
- Notification delivery system
- User presence and activity tracking

### Test Journey Prioritization

**Priority 1 - Authentication & User Management:**
- Essential for all other functionality
- Well-established backend implementation
- Clear acceptance criteria from existing stories

**Priority 2 - Assignment Workflows:**
- Core business functionality
- Depends on user management foundation
- Critical for assessment lifecycle

**Priority 3 - Document Viewing:**
- Key differentiator feature
- Complex browser compatibility requirements
- Performance-critical functionality

**Priority 4 - Messaging System:**
- Enhances user collaboration
- Real-time functionality testing complexity
- Cross-browser WebSocket testing required

### Testing Standards

**Test File Organization:**
- `cypress/e2e/auth/` - Authentication journey tests
- `cypress/e2e/user-management/` - User management workflow tests
- `cypress/e2e/assignments/` - Assignment lifecycle tests
- `cypress/e2e/documents/` - Document viewing and interaction tests
- `cypress/e2e/messaging/` - Real-time messaging tests
- `cypress/e2e/integration/` - Cross-role integration scenarios

**Test Data Strategy:**
- Use existing TestDataFactory patterns for consistent test users
- Create test scenarios with realistic data volumes
- Implement test data versioning for different test scenarios
- Ensure test data isolation between test suites

**Testing Framework Requirements:**
- Page Object Model for maintainable test structure
- Custom commands for common operations (login, navigation)
- Retry logic for flaky real-time functionality
- Screenshot and video capture for debugging failures

### Integration Points

**Backend API Integration:**
- Test real API endpoints, not mocked responses
- Validate API response structures and error handling
- Test authentication and authorization middleware
- Verify database state changes from UI actions

**Frontend Component Testing:**
- Validate Angular component behavior and state management
- Test responsive design and mobile compatibility
- Verify accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Test browser-specific functionality and compatibility

**Real-time Features:**
- Test SignalR WebSocket connections and message delivery
- Validate real-time UI updates and state synchronization
- Test connection resilience and reconnection logic
- Verify message ordering and delivery guarantees
